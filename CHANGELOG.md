# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Audit any Hugging Face dataset** (`redteam corpora audit-hf`) — point the
  audit at any adversarial dataset on the Hub (with `--revision` to pin it), not
  just the four built-in corpora. The safety exclusion filter runs first, so an
  ad-hoc dataset can't smuggle excluded content into a report. New schema values
  `source="external"` / `category="unknown"` back it.

## [0.2.0] — the adversarial benchmark foundry

Repositioned from a static red-team harness into an upstream **benchmark
foundry**. The v1 measurement core is unchanged; these are additive.

### Added
- **Corpus quality audit** (`redteam corpora audit`) — exact + near-duplicate
  detection including cross-source overlap, composition, prompt-length stats,
  and label-integrity checks, rendered as a quality report + data card.
- **Language + attack-family taxonomy** — script-based language/code-switching
  detection and heuristic attack-family surface markers, surfaced in the audit.
- **Benchmark staleness scoring** (`redteam corpora staleness`) — a transparent,
  component-broken-out heuristic composing corpus and run signals.
- **Benign control set + defence comparison** (`redteam compare-defences`,
  `redteam benign export`) — false-refusal rate and
  `safe_usefulness = (1 - ASR) * (1 - FRR)` per defence config.
- **Multilingual over-refusal** (`redteam frr-by-language`,
  `redteam benign export --multilingual`) — benign control set in
  zh-Hant / zh-Hans / ja / ko + code-switched, with per-language FRR.
- **Challenge-pack exporter** (`redteam export-pack`) — versioned packs
  (`pack.yaml` + `scenarios.jsonl` + `datacard.md`) with adversarial prompts
  redacted by default, plus a reader (`redteam.packs.read_challenge_pack`) and
  a downstream consumption contract (`examples/export_to_agent_release_gates.md`).
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`; committed real-data findings under `reports/samples/`.

### Fixed
- Exclusion-filter leaks (WMD "synthesis" noun, several self-harm phrasings,
  case-insensitive category gate) with regression tests.
- Budget guard now **reserves** its estimate so concurrent calls can't
  collectively exceed the per-run cap.
- Llama Guard fails **closed** on an empty/errored verdict.
- Spotlighting / SecAlign neutralise their own fence markers in untrusted input
  (closes a delimiter-injection bypass); SecAlign no longer passes messages
  through unfenced.
- OpenAI target fails loud without a pricing entry (no silent $0 budget bypass).
- Krippendorff's α finite-sample correction; `compute_kappa` blank-cell guard;
  cross-judge agreement reports `None` (not `0.0`) when not computable.

### Changed
- Default install slimmed: the unused dashboard deps (`streamlit`, `plotly`)
  moved to an opt-in `[dashboard]` extra. The audit / staleness / dedup path
  needs no API key.

## [0.1.0] — v1 measurement core

- Loaders for AdvBench, JailbreakBench, HarmBench, AgentDojo (commit-pinned) with
  a safety exclusion filter.
- Anthropic + Ollama targets (OpenAI stub); disk response cache; per-run and
  per-call budget guards.
- Six composable defences (system prompt, Constitutional, Spotlighting,
  SecAlign, Llama Guard 4 pre/post).
- Rule-based + LLM-judge scoring with an independent cross-judge; bootstrap
  confidence intervals; Cohen's κ and Krippendorff's α.
- UK AISI Inspect eval-log export.
